# Contributing to marker.js Live

Thank you for your interest in contributing to marker.js Live. Before you proceed, please read this short guide.

## No Pull Requests, please
marker.js Live is not a "true" OSS project. It's a personal (private) project with a source code repository publicly available.

Therefore, it would be an unnecessary burden to resolve all the legal and other issues arising from accepting third party code contributions.

If you find a bug or want to make a feature request, please open an issue, and let's discuss it there.

Thank you,
Alan.
